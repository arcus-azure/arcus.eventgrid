# Introduction

Arcus EventGrid builds on top of Microsoft technology to provide the user with transient publishing and safely registering event publishing to your application with the [Arcus secret store](https://security.arcus-azure.net/features/secret-store). EventGrid is often used in integration tests, so we made sure that retrieving events is easy, transient, and customizable.

# Installation
